# Ethical AI for Student Mental Health Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student mental health outcomes using machine learning, with an emphasis on ethical AI practices. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to accurately identify students at risk of mental health issues while adhering to ethical guidelines.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying and selecting significant features that contribute to the model's predictive power.
- **Model Training:** Using a Random Forest classifier to predict mental health outcomes.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensuring the model is unbiased, transparent, and used in a way that benefits students.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset, addressing any missing or inconsistent data.
- **Modeling:** Built and tuned a Random Forest classifier, optimizing its performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Insights and Conclusion:** Discussed the importance of ethical AI and how the model can support student well-being.

## Ethical Considerations
Bias Mitigation: Ensured the model does not favor any particular group based on demographic attributes.
Transparency: Documented all processes clearly, allowing for reproducibility.
Student Well-being: The primary goal is to use predictions to provide timely support to students in need.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict student mental health outcomes with a focus on ethical AI. By leveraging the predictive power of Random Forest, educators and counselors can identify at-risk students and provide necessary interventions, ensuring that the model is used in a manner that prioritizes student well-being.
